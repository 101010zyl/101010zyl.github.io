# Class Project of C Programming Language

This is a emulator of USV developed in C in Borland C++ 3.1 installed in Dosbox, which is a really weird environment to work with :).

## Introduction
The goal of the program is to emulate the movement of unmanned surface vehicle in a lake. 
The program is developed completely in C, compiled and run in Borland C++ 3.1, and the graphics are developed using the libraries in Dosbox. 

## Technical Details
To emulate the movement of the USV, we employ A* and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. 
The USV is represented by a small boat, and the lake is represented by a 2D array. The program is developed in Borland C++ 3.1, and the graphics are developed using the libraries in Dosbox.
