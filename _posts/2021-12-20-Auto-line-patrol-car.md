# Auto Line Patrol Car
This is a project of a auto line patrol car. 
The car is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller, and the line is detected by the sensors in front of the car. 
The car can patrol along the line and avoid going out of the track. 
I'm responsible for the control algorithm in this project.
